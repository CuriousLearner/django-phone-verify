Welcome to Django Phone Verify's Documentation!
===============================================

**Django Phone Verify** is a lightweight and flexible Django app that enables easy phone number verification via SMS.

It supports pluggable backends such as **Twilio** and **Nexmo (Vonage)**, and can be extended to work with any other SMS service.
Users receive a security code via SMS and verify their phone numbers by submitting that code to your API.

Whether you're building registration flows, login mechanisms, or two-factor authentication â€”
Django Phone Verify provides the core functionality so you can focus on your business logic.
